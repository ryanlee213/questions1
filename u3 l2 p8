Challenge - Beware of Monty Hall
You are on a game show and given the choice of whatever is behind three doors
Behind one door is a fantastic prize, the other two doors are duds
You pick a door
The host opens one of the other two doors to reveal a dud
The host now gives you the opportunity to switch your door
What should you do?

(The probability of picking the right door is initially 1/3. This increases to 1/2 when it is revealed that one of the other doors is a dud. The probability of picking a dud is initially 2/3, which decreases to 1/2 when it is down to 2 doors...) - initial train of thought

You pick one door. There is a 1/3 chance you have picked correctly. There is a 2/3 chance that the prize is behind the other 2 doors. Now, when the host reveals a door to be a dud, that 2/3 chance stays the same, except now it's a 2/3 chance the door is behind the one other door, while the chance that you picked correctly is still 1/3.
