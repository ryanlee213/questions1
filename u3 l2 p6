a test for Thripshaw's Disease has a 98% probability of giving a positive result when applied to a person suffering from the disease; 10% probability of giving a (false) positive when given to a non-sufferer
0.5% of the population are sufferers
a test is administered to a person whose disease status is unknown. 

Calculate the probability that the test will:

Be positive
Correctly diagnose a sufferer of Thripshaw's
Correctly identify a non-sufferer of Thripshaw's
Misclassify the person

98%  ∗∗  0.5% + 10%  ∗∗  99.5% = .49 + 9.95 = 10.44%
98%
90%
2%  ∗∗  0.5% + 10.0%  ∗∗  99.5% = .0996%
